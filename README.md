# Note App React

This is a simple Note-taking application built with React and Vite. The project uses modern frontend tools like Vite for bundling and React for building the UI. Below you can find instructions on how to install and run the project, as well as details about the dependencies and development tools used.

## Installation

To install the project dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the following command to install the required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will install both the production and development dependencies listed in `package.json`.

## Scripts

The project uses several NPM scripts for development and building the application. You can run these scripts using the following commands:

- **`npm run dev`**: Starts the development server using Vite.
- **`npm run build`**: Builds the project for production using Vite.
- **`npm run lint`**: Runs ESLint to check for code style and potential issues in your JavaScript and JSX files.
- **`npm run preview`**: Serves the production build locally for previewing the build output.

## Dependencies

The following are the main dependencies required for the application to run in production:

- **`react` (^18.3.1)**: The core library for building user interfaces in React.
- **`react-dom` (^18.3.1)**: Provides DOM-specific methods that are necessary for rendering React components in the browser.

## Dev Dependencies

These packages are used during the development process to enhance the development experience, enforce code quality, and provide necessary type definitions:

- **`@types/react` (^18.3.3)**: TypeScript definitions for React, ensuring strong typing in your project.
- **`@types/react-dom` (^18.3.0)**: TypeScript definitions for ReactDOM.
- **`@vitejs/plugin-react` (^4.3.1)**: A plugin that enables React support in Vite, including JSX transformation and fast refresh.
- **`eslint` (^8.57.0)**: A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code to ensure code quality.
- **`eslint-plugin-react` (^7.34.3)**: A set of ESLint rules for React applications, ensuring React-specific code quality.
- **`eslint-plugin-react-hooks` (^4.6.2)**: An ESLint plugin that enforces the rules of Hooks in React.
- **`eslint-plugin-react-refresh` (^0.4.7)**: A plugin that integrates React Fast Refresh into ESLint, ensuring quick updates during development.
- **`vite` (^5.3.4)**: A fast, modern development server and build tool optimized for frontend projects.

## Development

To start the development server and begin developing the app, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local server that supports hot module replacement, allowing you to see your changes instantly in the browser.

## Building the Project

To build the project for production, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate an optimized and minified version of the application in the `dist` folder.

## Previewing the Build

Once you have built the project, you can preview the build locally to ensure everything is working as expected:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This will serve the production build on a local server, allowing you to test the final output.
